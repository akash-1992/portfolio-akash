     I have tried to create a manual controller which tries overlapping an upbeat rising musical piece over a sad instrumental music piece in the background.
      <br>
     Just click on the grey canvas for the piece to start. Use keys - a,s,d : to input the initial beats of the upbeat music. 
      <br>
     Use keys - j,k,l : to input the converging beats of the upbeat music. Use keys - 1,2,3,4 : to change the position of cue time in the background sad music. 
      <br>
     Use keys - 7,8,9,0 : to change the playback rate of the background sad music.
